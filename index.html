		<h1 id = "maintitle">The Internet<br> As A Puzzle</h1>
		<p>The internet contains a plethora of information, data and knowledge. It is home to a number of internet communities and niches each with their own specifc slang and jargon.
	Looking in from the outside, understanding this language might be confusing.<br><br>	However, despite this, and despite any differences these communities might have, at the very heart of the internet, understood by and uniting all these different people, are memes.  </p>

<!--Ideation -->

	<header id ="one" >
		<section>
			<h1 id = "ideation">Ideation: 6 October</h1>
			<p id = "ideationp">When first approaching this project I was going to try and develop my work from project three, and meld it into something fitting for this project.
				For project 3 I created a random recipe generator, where users would be able to upload their own recipes and generate random recipes from other people. However I struggled to translate this to a physical form, and I felt
					like it wasn't particularly representative of the internet as a whole

<br>	<br>	Instead I decided to take this oppurtunity to bring to life something which truly represented the internet. <br> <br>I came up with three initial ideas - a physical calendar or wall planner which had a different meme for every month of the year, a puzzle of memes, and a flip book which played out a popular vine as you flipped through it.
			<br><br> Since this project required we design for an audience, I decided not to do a calendar. A wall planner would have more interaction but I still felt like it wasn't really audience based.
		<br> <br> A flipbook would be incredibly interactive, relying completely on an audience/user for it to function, except I didn't want to distill the essence of the internet down to just one, max two vines.
	<br><br> So I decided to develop a jigsaw puzzle with memes as the picture. Jigsaws are interactive and like flip books require an audience to function. With a jigsaw puzzle I would also be able to include lots of different memes rather than one or two. </p>

<!--Concept-->

	<header id = "two">
		<section >
			<h1 id = "concept">Concept</h1>
			<p id = "conceptp">Internet Yami-Ichi focuses around the idea of "browsing" face to face, and translating elements of the internet into physical forms. I decided to create something that would fit into this category.
				A jigsaw puzzle is interactive, and can be used by an individual or a group of people socially, just as the internet can be. </p>
<br>
 Memes are essentially a form of communication, and being largely picture based, can be easily understood by people no matter what language they speak. Jigsaw puzzles are a simple concept, and like memes, are a visual medium which do not require words to understand how they work and how to interact with them. Therefore I thought
it was quite fitting to create a meme jigsaw puzzle.
		<br>
<BR>
		My concept for this project is a Meme Jigsaw Puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle made up of memes. I wanted to select memes from the internet which were considered classic and would be recognised by nearly everyone . The memes I chose were ones that I have personally seen and interacted with on the internet with great frequency, so I do acknowledge they might
				differ to the memes someone else would consider popular. I essentially wanted to distill internet culture down into a puzzle.

<!--Process - Inital Design-->

	<header id = "three">
		<section>
			<h1 id = 'process'>Process - Initial Designs: 7 October</h1>
			<p id = "processp"> <p> I looked online for popular memes, especially on knowyourmeme.com which was immensely helpful. I chose some which I felt were particularly iconic and popular, and which I had seen with great frequency all over the internet over the last several years. <br> <br>
				I mocked up the puzzle designs on Adobe Photoshop, going for a layered and cluttered look for the front of the puzzle.
				On a different layer I added a puzzle template so I would know where to cut the pieces. I did the same for the back of the puzzle.</p>

	<!-- Printing and Paper -->

	<header id = "four">
		<section>
			<h1 id = "printing">Printing & Paper: 7 October</h1>
			<p id = "printingp">At university I printed out several copies of my puzzle designs on A3 printing paper, and also went
			and bought some card from Gordon Harris for the puzzle backing. I considered making my puzzle bigger, however for ease of printing and presentation I decided to keep it at an A3 size.
			<br>
	<br>	I later realised I did not need the puzzle template on the back design and removed it in Photoshop, then went back and printed some copies without the template.</p>

<!--PIECING IT TOGETHER 1-->

	</section>
	<header id = "five">
		<section>
			<h1 id = "piecing1">Piecing it Together I: 8 October</h1>
			<p id = "piecing1p">With everything printed and all the supplies I needed, I started to make the puzzle. I glued down the two sides of the puzzle
			onto the card and made sure there were as few air bubbles as possible. Once this was dry, I began to cut out the puzzle pieces using a pair of scissors and nail scissors. <br> <br>
			After cutting out a few pieces, I realised that the puzzle would look a lot better without the black divider lines. So I went back into Photoshop and lowered the opacity so they were barely visible, but just enough that I could figure out where to cut the pieces.
			At this point I also added in a couple more memes to the design, this time more recent ones to cover a wider range of internet culture.
			<br><br>	During this initial process of cutting out puzzle pieces I also realised that using scissors to cut the puzzle pieces was very inefficient and quite messy, so I also went out and bought a scalpel to use instead.</p>

<!--PIECING IT TOGETHER 2-->

	<header id = "six">

			<h1 id = "piecing2">Piecing it Together II: 8 October</h1>
			<p id = "piecing1p">	<p>After printing out the new copies and buying a scalpel, I got back to making the puzzle.
				The scalpel made it much easier to get the precise puzzle shapes, but it was still quite a tedious process.
</p>

				<p> Using a gluestick to glue down the puzzle design to the card meant it took a lot of glue to stick the paper down
				properly. With many of the pieces the edges peeled up at the sides, so I had to tidy up many of the pieces at the end.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="g-50">
				<img id = "progress" src ="img/detail.jpg">
				<p> Some edge detail - Even using a scalpel it was difficult to get perfect edges. Cutting through the two pieces of paper and the card meant often one of them got a little damaged.
					<br> If I were to approach this project again I would try out cutting the card first and then the paper so less damage would be done to the actual puzzle designs.

<!--CONCLUSION-->
	<header id = "seven">
		<section>
			<h1 id = "conclusion">Conclusion - Complete Project: 9 October</h1>
			<p id = "conclusionp">	<p>This is the finished puzzle. I am quite happy with how it turned out. It carried out the concept I wanted it to, being representative of universal internet culture and communication. <br> <br> This project was quite challenging particularly because it was working
				with physical objects rather than digitally.
				A lot of things during the process took much longer than I expected. Cutting out the puzzle pieces was incredibly time consuming and fiddly. It was difficult to make the puzzle pieces perfectly clean cut. If I were to approach this differently I would set aside some time to learn how to use the laser cutter
				to get more precise pieces.
		<br><br>		I also should have been more prepared with how many copies of each side I would need to print out, to make room for mistakes. Also related to printing,
				I initially printed from an iMac to one printer, which later ran out of A3 paper. When this happened I went downstairs to print from a Windows computer. The sizing and settings printed from here were slightly different and it was more difficult to get the settings I wanted.
				This is also something I would keep in mind in the future.
				 If my time management had been better I would have liked to spend more time making the puzzle more polished and professional.
<br> <br> Despite all this, overall I am happy with the result of this project, there were no major roadblocks or changes and I was able to carry out my original concept.</p>
