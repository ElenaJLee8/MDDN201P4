		<h1 id = "maintitle">The Internet - Distilled Into A Puzzle</h1>
		<p>The internet contains a plethora of information, data and knowledge. It is home to a number of internet communities and niches each with their own specifc slang and jargon. <br>
		Despite any differences these communities might have, at the very heart of the internet, uniting all these different people are memes.  </p>

<!--Ideation -->

	<header id ="one" >
		<section>
			<h1 id = "ideation">Ideation</h1>
			<p id = "ideationp">When first approaching this project I was going to try and develop my work from project three, and meld it into something fitting for this project. It wouldn't have been overally related to the internet or it's culture though.
				However I decided instead to take this oppurtunity to bring to life something which truly represented the internet. <br> <br>I came up with three initial ideas - a physical calendar or wall planner which had a different meme for every month of the year, a puzzle of memes, and a flip book which played out a popular vine as you flipped through it.
			<br><br> Since this project requires we design for an audience, I decided not to do a calendar. A wall planner would have more interaction but I still felt like it wasn't really audience based.
		<br> <br> A flipbook would be incredibly interactive, relying completely on an audience/user for it to function, except I didn't want to distill the essence of the internet down to just one, max two vines.
	<br><br> So I decided to develop a jigsaw puzzle with memes as the picture. Jigsaws are interactive and like flip books require an audience to function. With a jigsaw puzzle I would also be able to include lots of different memes rather than one or two. </p>

<!--Concept-->

	<header id = "two">
		<section >
			<h1 id = "concept">Concept</h1>
			<p id = "conceptp">Internet Yami-Ichi focuses around the idea of "browsing" face to face, translating internet objects into physical form. 
		<br>		My concept for this project was a Meme Jigsaw Puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle made up of memes.I wanted to select memes from the internet which were considered classic and would be recognised by nearly everyone.
I wanted to put the last couple of years of internet culture into my puzzle.<br>
A jigsaw puzzle is interactive, and can be used by an individual or a group of people socially, just as the internet can be. </p>

<!--Process - Inital Design-->

			<h1 id = 'process'>Process - Initial Designs</h1>
			<p id = "processp"> <p> I looked online for popular memes, especially on knowyourmeme which was immensely helpful, and chose some which I felt were particularly iconic and popular. These are the intial puzzle designs I came up with, created using Adobe Photoshop. </p>

	<!-- Printing and Paper -->

			<h1 id = "printing">Printing & Paper </h1>
			<p id = "printingp">At university I printed out several copies of my puzzle designs, and also went
			and bought some card stock from Gordon Harris for the puzzle backing.
	<br>	I later realised I did not need the puzzle template on the back design and removed it in Photoshop, then went back and printed some templateless copies</p>

			<h1 id = "piecing1">Piecing it Together I </h1>
			<p id = "piecing1p">With everything printed and all the supplies I needed I started to make the puzzle. I glued down the two sides of the puzzle
			onto the card and made sure there were as few air bubbles as possible. Once this was dry, I began to cut out the puzzle pieces using a pair of scissors and nail scissors. After cutting out a few pieces,
			I also added in a couple more memes to the design. <br> <br>
			I realised that the puzzle would look a lot better without the black divider lines. So I went back into Photoshop and lowered the opacity so they were barely visible, but just enough that I could figure out where to cut the pieces.
		During this process I also realised that using scissors to cut the puzzle pieces was very inefficient and quite messy, so I also went out and bought a scalpel to use instead.</p>

			<h1 id = "conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
			<p id = "conclusionp">	<p>These is the finished puzzle. I am quite happy with how it turned out, and it carried out the concept I wanted it to, being representative of internet culture. This project was quite challenging particularly because it was working
				with physical objects rather than digitally.<br> A lot of things during the process took much longer than I expected. Cutting out the puzzle pieces was incredibly time consuming and fiddly.
				I also should have been more prepared with how many copies of each side I would need to print out, to make room for mistakes.
				 If my time management had been better I would have liked to spend more time making the puzzle more polished and professional.
